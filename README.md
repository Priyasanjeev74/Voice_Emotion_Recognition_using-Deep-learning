# Voice_Emotion_Recognition_using-Deep-learning
Voice Emotion Recognition (VER) also referred to as speech analysis involves identifying and interpreting emotions expressed through speech. This project is centered around leveraging deep learning approaches to accurately analyze emotions, from speech data. Current VER methods utilize Markov models (HMM) and different pre-processing techniques. However these techniques face challenges with overlapping speech and inconsistencies in types resulting in an accuracy rate of approximately 71%. In our proposed system our goal is to enhance accuracy by integrating learning with deep learning methods like ADRNN, MFCC, MER, SVM and other CNN technologies. We have also developed speech analysis and classification methods to extract emotions from voice signals using accessible datasets. Deep learning methodologies have demonstrated promising outcomes across a range of domains including speech recognition; thus we anticipate that they can greatly boost the accuracy and efficiency of emotion detection, in speech signals.
